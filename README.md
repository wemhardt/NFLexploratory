# Abstract: The main purpose of this project was to help the visual learners who work in the NFL. Now a scout can visualize where a player lies on the spectrum, as opposed to comparing players to a standard set of numbers/averages.  Many comparisons are encoded in this web-app to assist scouts to look at players from many different angles.
# Data Description: The NFL combine csv or dataset has a multitude of different measures which are taken at the NFL Combine annually.  Lucky enough, each year the Combine is hosted by Indianapolis in March, during the NFL offseason.  Data columns range from height, weight, and hand size to more skill-based challenges such as 40-yard run, bench press and vertical leap.
# Algorithm Description: The algorithm essentially consists of a bunch of 'if' statements that are only applied based on what the user selects to do with the app.  For example, the first if statement allows for the user to see the first few rows of their data.  Further down, the user may check a box that will create a histogram of a certain column.
# Tools Used: Obviously streamlit was used to create the web-app in totality.  Pandas was used to load in a certain csv of your liking, for our purpose the clean NFL combine data.  Seaborn and matplotlib were used to help build the visualizations within the app.
